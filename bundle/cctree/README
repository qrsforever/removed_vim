Description:
       Plugin generates symbol dependency tree (aka call tree, call graph) in real-time inside Vim using a Cscope database. Basic support for functions and macros; global variables, enums, typedefs can be cross-reference with additional processing. Functionality similar to that of tools and IDE's like CBrowser, Kscope, Source navigator, Eclipse, Source Insight. 

Currently supported language: C. 
Requirements: Cscope, Vim 7.xx

[NEW]: Check out  http://sourceforge.net/projects/ccglue/ for an external tool that can produce cross-reference files from cscope [and ctags] databases that CCTree can load directly from disk.
